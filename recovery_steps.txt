Task 5 - Breaking and Recovering a Git Project

1. Deleted README.md and modified feature.txt
2. Committed the broken state with message "Broke the repo"
3. Ran `git reflog` to locate the previous good commit
4. Identified HEAD@{1} as the correct state before damage
5. Used `git reset --hard HEAD@{1}` to restore repository
6. Used `git clean -fd` to remove untracked files
7. Verified repository state using `git status`

Result: Repository successfully restored to a clean working state.
